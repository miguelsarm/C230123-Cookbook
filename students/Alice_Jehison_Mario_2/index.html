    <h1>Buckeye Bundt Cake</h1>
    <img src="https://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2023/11/21/FNK_Buckeye-Bundt-Cake_H1.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.826.620.suffix/1700603567242.jpeg" />
    <p><span>The classic flavors of buckeye candy — chocolate and peanut butter — are the winning combination in this bundt cake that’s ideal for serving a crowd. A creamy peanut butter cheesecake mixture is sandwiched inside rich chocolate cake, and a final topping of melted semisweet chocolate makes it irresistible. You can even bake and glaze it a day or two ahead and store it in the fridge.</span></p>

    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        <span>1 tablespoon powdered peanut butter</span>
    </p>

    <h3>Topping:</h3>
    <p>
        <span>8 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped</span>
    </p>  
    <h2>
      <span>Directions</span>
    </h2>  
    <p>
        <span>1, For the chocolate cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 10-cup nonstick bundt pan with cooking spray.
        </span>  
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>2, For the chocolate cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 10-cup nonstick bundt pan with cooking spray.         </span>  
    </p> 
    <p>
        <span>3, Combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl; set aside.        </span>  
    </p> 
    <p>
        <span>4, Add the granulated sugar and oil to the stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium speed until combined, scraping the sides of the bowl as needed, about 1 minute. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well between each addition. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in a third of the flour mixture followed by 1/2 cup of the sour cream. Repeat with another third of the flour mixture and the remaining 1/2 cup sour cream. End with the remaining third of the flour mixture, scraping the bowl if needed so that everything is incorporated.         </span>  
    </p> 
    <p>
        <span>5,Combine the brown sugar and powdered peanut butter in a small bowl.         </span>  
    </p> 
    <p>
        <span>6, Spoon half of the chocolate cake batter into the prepared pan and smooth with the back of a spoon. Sprinkle with half of the brown sugar mixture, making sure all of the cake batter is covered. Spoon the cheesecake mixture over top, smoothing it out with the back of a spoon. Sprinkle over the remaining brown sugar mixture, covering all of the cheesecake. Top with the remaining cake batter and smooth it out with the back of a spoon.</span> 
    </p> 
    <p>
        <span>7, Bake until the cake looks set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 20 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour.         </span>  
    </p> 
    <p>
        <span>8, For the topping: Bring some water to a boil in a small pot. Add the chocolate to a medium heatproof bowl and place over the boiling water, making sure that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Heat the chocolate, stirring occasionally, until melted, about 4 minutes.         </span>  
    </p> 
    <p>
        <span>9, Pour the chocolate over the cake, letting it spread over the top and drip down the sides, helping it along with a spatula if need be to spread it to the edges. Let the chocolate set in the refrigerator, about 30 minutes. The cake can be stored, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.         </span>  
    </p>
    <h3>Cook’s Note</h3>
    <p>
        <span>When measuring flour, we spoon it into a dry measuring cup and level off excess. (Scooping directly from the bag compacts the flour, resulting in dry baked goods.)</span>

      1 Banana - Use a very ripe banana with a few brown spots to add natural sweetness. <br />
      1 cup Milk - Gluten free waffles tend to absorb more liquid than regular ones. <br />
      1/2 teaspoons baking powder. <br />
