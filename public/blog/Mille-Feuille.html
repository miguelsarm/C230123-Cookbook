          <li class="relative ol-li">
            Prepare homemade rough puff pastry dough through 2nd refrigeration.
            If using store-bought frozen puff pastry, thaw according to package
            directions. Keep either dough in the refrigerator until step 7
            below.
          </li>
          <li class="relative ol-li">
            Make the pastry cream: In a large heatproof bowl (preferably with a
            pour spout), whisk the egg yolks and cornstarch together with a
            fork. It may not look like it will all come together (it will be dry
            at first), but keep mixing until the mixture is thick and combined.
            If it’s not coming together at all, add a few drops of the milk you
            need in step 3 to bring together. Set aside at room temperature.
          </li>
          <li class="relative ol-li">
            Combine the milk and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
            Whisk until the sugar has dissolved, then bring to a gentle simmer.
            Remove from heat. Pour the warm milk and sugar mixture in a slow and
            steady stream into the egg yolk and cornstarch mixture, whisking the
            entire time. Keep those egg yolks moving so they don’t scramble.
            Over a sieve, to strain out any egg yolk solids that may have formed
            during tempering, pour the mixture back into the saucepan.
          </li>
          <li class="relative ol-li">
            Return the saucepan to medium heat, and whisk constantly. The
            mixture will be frothy on the surface at first, and then it will
            begin to thicken quickly and large bubbles will begin to burst on
            the surface. This usually takes about 1–2 minutes. Stand back and
            use caution. Let the bubbles burst for about 20 seconds, or until
            the mixture has thickened into a custard- or pudding-like
            consistency. (For a more accurate test, the custard is done when the
            temperature reaches 185–190°F (85–88°C).) Remove from heat. Whisk in
            butter, vanilla extract, vanilla bean seeds, and a pinch of salt.
            Cool for 10 minutes.
          </li>
          <li class="relative ol-li">
            Transfer the pastry cream from the saucepan to a heatproof bowl and
            place a piece of plastic wrap or parchment directly on the surface
            of the custard, to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate for at
            least 3 hours, and up to 24 hours.
          </li>
          <li class="relative ol-li">
            Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Line a 12×17-inch baking sheet (half
            sheet pan) with parchment paper. Have a second baking sheet and more
            parchment paper out as well. Set aside.
          </li>
          <li class="relative ol-li">
            Shape the dough: On a floured work surface using a floured rolling
            pin, roll pastry dough into a rectangle about 11×16 inches in size.
          </li>
          <li class="relative ol-li">
            Transfer the dough to the lined baking sheet. Dock the surface with
            a fork to allow steam to escape. Place a second piece of parchment
            paper on top of the pastry dough. Set a second baking sheet, filled
            with pie weights (or dried beans, or other options see recipe Note
            below) on top. Bake for 20 minutes with pan & weights on top. Remove
            from oven and carefully remove the top weighted baking sheet and the
            top piece of parchment. Return the uncovered pastry to the oven for
            7–9 more minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and
            cool for 20 minutes on the pan, and then carefully lift it and place
            on a cooling rack to cool completely.
          </li>
          <li class="relative ol-li">
            Finish the cream filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted
            with a whisk attachment, whip the cold heavy cream on medium-high
            speed until medium peaks form, about 3 minutes. Add the chilled
            pastry cream to the bowl with the whipped cream. Beat on low speed
            until just combined and smooth. Do not over-mix. Cover and
            refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours.
          </li>
          <li class="relative ol-li">
            Assemble the pastries: Using a large, very sharp knife, trim around
            the sides of the cooled pastry to straighten up any uneven edges.
            Use the knife to cut the pastry into 15 squares roughly uniform in
            size. NOTE: The pastry will shrink some while baking. After starting
            with dough rolled out to 11×16 inches, after baking it typically
            ends up around 9–10×14–15 inches. So if you have a baked pastry
            that’s 9×15 inches (after trimming the edges), your 15 squares will
            be 3×3 inches. If your pastry is a slightly different size, don’t
            panic! Use a measuring tape or ruler to measure the sides to
            determine exactly how wide to space your cuts. Measure the long side
            and divide by 5, then measure the short side and divide by 3.
          </li>
          <li class="relative ol-li">
            Make & add the topping: In a small bowl, whisk together the sifted
            confectioners’ sugar, milk, and vanilla until combined and smooth.
            Place the chopped chocolate in a small microwave-safe bowl or liquid
            measuring cup. Melt in 20-second increments in the microwave,
            stirring after each increment, until completely melted and smooth.
            Transfer the melted chocolate to a squeeze bottle or a piping bag
            fitted with a small round tip, or use a small plastic sandwich bag
            and cut off a bottom corner. Place 5 pastry squares on a wire rack
            set over parchment paper. With a spoon or icing spatula, spoon and
            spread the vanilla icing on one square. Before the icing has a
            chance to set, pipe 4 lines of melted chocolate across each top. Use
            a toothpick to create a chevron design, dragging it across the
            stripes in a perpendicular direction. Alternate directions with the
            toothpick, wiping the toothpick end with a paper towel in between
            each pass. Repeat with the remaining 4 pastry squares.
          </li>
          <li class="relative ol-li">
            Assemble the mille-feuille: Fit a pastry/piping bag with a large
            round tip. Or, you can simply use a large plastic bag and snip off a
            bottom corner with scissors. Starting with one of the
            (plain/un-iced) pastry squares, pipe 3 dollops of cream filling in 3
            rows (9 dollops total). Place another (plain) pastry square on top,
            pressing down very lightly. Repeat the piping of 9 dollops on the
            next layer. Place one of the decorated (iced) pastry squares on top
            of the second layer of cream filling. Repeat with the remaining
            pastry squares; you will have 5 assembled pastries. Refrigerate
            uncovered for at least 30 minutes before serving, or up to 8 hours.
            The soft filling will spill out the sides when you cut or bite into
            it, and that’s expected.
